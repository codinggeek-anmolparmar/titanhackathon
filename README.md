Fitness Score Estimation using Health Metrics  This repository contains code for estimating a person's fitness score based on their health metrics data. Note: The repository does not include the dataset.
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze a person's health metrics data and derive a fitness score that accurately reflects their overall health and fitness level. The health metrics include heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, stress levels, resting heart rate, HRV, dopamine levels, blood sugar, respiratory rate, and more.

The project involves preprocessing the health metrics data by handling missing values, normalizing the features, and performing outlier detection and removal. Various machine learning algorithms and models are then applied to the preprocessed data, including regression models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score to assess their performance in predicting the fitness score.

Additionally, ensemble methods such as model stacking and model ensembling are employed to improve the predictive power of the models. The stacked features generated from the base models are used to train a meta-model, and ensembling techniques are applied to combine the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy.

The resulting fitness score derived from the machine learning models can provide valuable insights into an individual's overall health and fitness level. The project aims to create a reliable and efficient solution that can be applied in various domains such as fitness tracking, personalized healthcare, wellness programs, research studies, and health insurance.

The project code and implementation can be found in the GitHub repository, which includes data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, ensemble methods, and documentation on the approach and applications.
